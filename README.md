# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide for Bootcamp students working on their Prework Project to understand some basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  This is to help the students understand what they are learning as they are learning it.  It also provides a resourse to go back to during the full Bootcamp.  Building this study guide helped me start to understand these 4 coding tools, and gave me a platform to play around with some of their features.
